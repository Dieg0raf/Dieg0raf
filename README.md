### Hi there 🌱  

## 🖥️ My Portfolio  
Check out my portfolio website to see my projects and experience:

## 📘 Currently Learning  
I'm currently diving into operating systems to gain a better understanding of how computers work under the hood — from process management and memory to file systems and system calls. I'm reading *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* and documenting my journey and notes along the way.  
➡️ [**Textbook: Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces**](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)  
➡️ [**OS Learning Repository**](https://github.com/Dieg0raf/os)

## 🎯 Goals  
As I study operating systems, here are some key goals I’m working toward:

- 🧠 Deepen my understanding of how OSes work under the hood (processes, memory, file systems, system calls)
- ⚙️ Explore and modify the [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public) Unix-like teaching OS to learn about kernel internals
- 🔧 Write and edit custom system calls in xv6 to better understand user–kernel interactions
- 🛠️ Eventually build a minimal operating system from scratch to solidify everything I've learned
